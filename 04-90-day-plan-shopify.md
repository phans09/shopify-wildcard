# 04 — 90‑Day Plan for Shopify (Wildcard)

> A focused plan for creating value quickly while learning Shopify’s products and culture.

## Days 0–30 — Learn & earn trust
- Listen deeply across product, eng, data, support, and legal
- Identify 2–3 candidate use cases with clear value and low risk
- Stand up a **light evaluation harness** (quality, safety, red flags)
- Draft the **one‑page narrative** (why now, why this, how we’ll know it worked)

## Days 31–60 — Pilot & prove
- Run **Customer‑Zero style pilots** with real users and baselines
- Ship **micro‑enablement**: short videos, playbooks, FAQs
- Align governance with Security/Privacy/Legal; define graduation gates
- **Exec readout v1**: outcomes, scale path, resourcing asks

## Days 61–90 — Scale & systematize
- Graduate the strongest pilot to a broader audience with champions
- Publish the **Innovation Operating Model** + shared dashboard
- Build a sequenced backlog with ROI estimates
- **Exec readout v2**: what we proved, what’s next, how we’ll measure it

**Promise:** clear story, responsible guardrails, visible results, and a team proud of the work.
