# 03 — Remote Leadership Playbook

**How I run distributed teams with clarity, calm, and high standards.**

## Foundations
- **Clear owner + outcome.** No orphaned work. “Definition of won” is visible.
- **Async by default.** Live time is for decisions and connection.
- **Write the truth.** Risks and unknowns are documented; we fix systems, not people.

## Weekly rhythm
- **Monday (async 15 min):** goals, blockers, dependencies
- **Mid‑week:** demo‑in‑progress clip/screenshot
- **Friday:** outcomes digest for execs (what shipped, what moved, what needs help)

## Culture
- Kind and candid
- Celebrate learning and shipping
- Zero drama, lots of momentum
