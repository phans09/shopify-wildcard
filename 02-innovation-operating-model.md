# 02 — Innovation Operating Model

**Purpose:** A few simple rules that let teams move fast *and* safely.

## Principles
- **People first, then features.** Real problems > demo theater.
- **Safety is part of the UX.** Privacy, provenance, and red‑teaming aren’t afterthoughts.
- **Narrative + numbers.** Tell the story in one page; prove it with a dashboard.

## Cadence
- **Weekly outcomes:** demo or data.
- **Decision log:** 3 sentences max—what we chose and why.
- **Risk register:** owner, mitigation, next review date.

## Roles
- **Product:** problem framing, usage analytics, narrative.
- **Engineering:** delivery plan, quality gates, observability.
- **Security/Privacy/Legal:** guardrails, reviews, green‑light criteria.
- **Enablement:** playbooks, training, feedback loop to product.

## Metrics
- Time‑to‑first‑value (TTFV)
- Weekly active users / cohort retention
- Evaluation harness pass rate
- Contact/deflection rate
- Outcome metrics per use case
