# 01 — Customer Zero AI Playbook (Sanitized)

**Goal:** Prove value safely, then scale. Move from *demo* → *usable* → *trusted*.

## Frame
- **Reality:** Everyone wants the magic; very few have the plumbing, guardrails, or measures.
- **Approach:** Treat the company as **Customer Zero**. Earn trust with a small, instrumented pilot that becomes the template.

## Steps
1) **Define “win” in plain language.**  
   Examples: time‑to‑first‑draft, prep time, deflection rate, satisfaction.
2) **Assemble the triangle.**  
   Product/Eng, Security/Privacy/Legal, Business/Enablement.
3) **Map data paths + guardrails.**  
   Least privilege, red‑teaming, evaluation harness for prompts/outputs.
4) **Pilot with real users.**  
   Baseline first, then weekly deltas; capture good/bad/ugly.
5) **Change & enablement.**  
   Tiny playbooks, short videos, champions network.
6) **Graduate + scale.**  
   Clear gates, a dashboard, and a list of next best use cases.

## Example outcomes (illustrative)
- 30–50% faster first drafts for seller or support responses
- 20% less manual data stitching for weekly prep
- Higher satisfaction from pilot users; clear “don’t do this again” notes

## Artifacts
- Pilot charter (scope, ethics, measures)
- Data flow sketch + sign‑offs
- Enablement kit (playbooks, FAQ, micro‑lessons)
- Executive one‑pager with results + scale plan
