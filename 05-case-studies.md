## 1) From demo to daily use
**Situation:** Excitement around a new AI assistant; risk teams worried about data exposure.  
**Action:** Built a tiny pilot with a clean data path, least‑privilege access, and an eval harness for prompts/outputs.  
**Result:** 40% faster first drafts for a common workflow; green‑lit to expand with clear guardrails.

## 2) Governance that helps, not hinders
**Situation:** Multiple teams blocked by reviews that arrived too late.  
**Action:** Co‑designed a “pre‑flight checklist” with Security/Privacy/Legal and taught PMs how to self‑serve.  
**Result:** Review cycles shrank from weeks to days; confidence went up on both sides.

## 3) Enablement people love
**Situation:** Great features, low adoption.  
**Action:** Swapped long docs for short, friendly playbooks and 3‑minute screen recordings.  
**Result:** Usage grew steadily; PMs got clearer feedback, and support tickets dropped.
