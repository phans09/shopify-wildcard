# Hi, I’m **Sadina** 

**Sr. PM / TPM — AI Transformation — Remote‑first Leader — Future CINO**

I build the bridges between *frontier tech* and *real‑world outcomes*. My sweet spot is taking a fuzzy idea,
writing the story everyone can rally around, and shipping the first version that proves value—
safely, measurably, and with heart.

### What I’m great at
- **Customer‑Zero style pilots** that become the company playbook
- **Responsible AI**: data pathways, safety reviews, evaluation loops
- **Narrative + numbers**: crisp exec storytelling backed by metrics
- **Distributed leadership**: calm, kind, high standards across time zones

### A few wins I’m proud of 
- Turned ambiguous AI explorations into **measurable productivity gains** for large, global teams
- Built **lightweight governance** that let product teams move fast *and* pass privacy/security reviews
- Scaled enablement with **short, lovable playbooks** that people actually use

### What I’m exploring now
Agents that do one thing extremely well, evaluation harnesses that keep us honest, and operating models that help
teams move quickly without drama.
