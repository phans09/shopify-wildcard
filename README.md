# Hi, Iâ€™m **Sadina** ðŸ‘‹

**Sr. PM / TPM â€” AI Transformation â€” Remoteâ€‘first Leader â€” Future CINO**

I build the bridges between *frontier tech* and *realâ€‘world outcomes*. My sweet spot is taking a fuzzy idea,
writing the story everyone can rally around, and shipping the first version that proves valueâ€”
safely, measurably, and with heart.

### What Iâ€™m great at
- **Customerâ€‘Zero style pilots** that become the company playbook
- **Responsible AI**: data pathways, safety reviews, evaluation loops
- **Narrative + numbers**: crisp exec storytelling backed by metrics
- **Distributed leadership**: calm, kind, high standards across time zones

### A few wins Iâ€™m proud of (sanitized)
- Turned ambiguous AI explorations into **measurable productivity gains** for large, global teams
- Built **lightweight governance** that let product teams move fast *and* pass privacy/security reviews
- Scaled enablement with **short, lovable playbooks** that people actually use

### What Iâ€™m exploring now
Agents that do one thing extremely well, evaluation harnesses that keep us honest, and operating models that help
teams move quickly without drama.
